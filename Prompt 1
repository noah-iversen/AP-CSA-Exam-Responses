	A)
  This question involved the manipulation of a song playlist. The prompt asked to write two methods that would retrieve a song and remove a song according to certain specifications.
  
	public Song getNextSong() {
		Song nextSong;
		for(Song song : songList) {
			if(nextSong != null) {
				if(song.getLength() > nextSong.getLength()) {
					if(!song.getRecentlyPlayed()) {
						nextSong = song;
					}
				}
			} else {
				nextSong = song;
			}
		}
		nextSong.setPlayedToday();
		return nextSong;
	}


	B)
	
	public void removeLong() {
		Song nextSong = getNextSong();
		for(Song song : songList) {
			if(nextSong != song) {
				int songDiff = nextSong.getLength() - song.getLength();
				if(songDiff < 30 && songDiff > -30) {
					songList.remove(song);
				}
			}
		}
	}
